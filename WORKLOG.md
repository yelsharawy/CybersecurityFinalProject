Angela: Before this, we mainly tried researching and finding different resources for SHA-256. We found this website: https://blog.boot.dev/cryptography/how-sha-2-works-step-by-step-sha-256/ that gave us the basic steps and pseudocode for how it works. We're also working on delegating tasks and I'll look into code for rotating bits and xor-ing them.

Yusuf: I started work on the pre-processing section of the SHA-256 algorithm. We also created each of the files we needed in the repo. At the CS Dojo, I continued by creating the chunk loop and started working on the `createMessageSchedule` function.
