# Introduction to SHA-256

SHA-256 is a cryptographic hash function part of the SHA-2 family that generates a unique 256-bit (32 byte) signature for any input text. SHA stands for Secure Hash Algorithm.

## What is hashing?

Hashing is a one-way process of scrambling raw information that cannot be reverse-engineered back to its original form. This function is called the hash function and we call the output a hash value/digest. On the other hand, encryption is a two-way process that can be decrypted into a readable form again.

### Characteristics of the SHA algorithm:

* Input message length: In order to make sure the algorithm is as random as possible, the input message length should be maximum of 2^64 - 1 bits.
* Digest Length: The hash digest will always be 256 bits in size. Bigger digests usually suggest significantly more costly and spacious calculations.
* Irreversible Digest: The hash function will not return any form of the original plaintext by any means and will also return the same output given the same input.
